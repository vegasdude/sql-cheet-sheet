# About Example Table Names (employees, users, people, etc.)

In SQL examples, you will often see table names like **employees**, **users**, **people**,  
**customers**, or **students**. These names are not special keywords in SQL — they are  
simply example labels used to demonstrate queries.

## Why “employees” is often used in tutorials
- It is easy to understand.
- Works well for join examples (employees ↔ departments).
- Makes examples more realistic.
- Helps show common fields like `name`, `age`, `email`, or `department_id`.

## You can replace the table name with anything
These example names are placeholders.  
For your own projects, you might use:

- `users`
- `people`
- `members`
- `students`
- `clients`
- `customers`
- `accounts`
- `profiles`

### Example:
Tutorial example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
